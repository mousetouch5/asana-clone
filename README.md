# Asana Clone (Work in Progress)

This is a minimal clone project of [Asana](https://asana.com/). The features are currently under development and not yet fully implemented.

This project is based on the structure and design of [Iggy-Tech's Asana Clone](https://github.com/iggy-tech/asana-clone), and uses basic [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) templates along with open-source images.

> ⚠️ This is an early-stage scaffold project. Expect significant updates and feature improvements in the near future.
